# Glovo Tech Assignment

Project developed for Glovo's recruitment process. 

## Introducción
At Glovo, our aim is to give everyone easy access to anything in their city. Wouldn’t it be great to accompany this food with some exotic cocktails?!

### Development

- Step 1: fetch all the cocktails which have a name beginning with “G” from The Cocktail DB public API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).
- Step 2: log the names of all the cocktails found as well as the total number.
- Step 3: keep the cocktails that have more than 4 ingredients. Log the name for each of the results.
- Step 4: update the parsed list but instead of just saving the ingredients in the array, save the ingredient as an object with its name and quantity. Log the results.
- Step 5: we want to be able to offer our customers both alcoholic and non-alcoholic
cocktails. Separate the results into two lists based on this. Log the results.
